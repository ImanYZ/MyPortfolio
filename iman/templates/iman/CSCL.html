                      <p>I believe education system needs to produce learning lovers who enjoy finding things out for themselves, otherwise the system will produce proficient test takers who do not enjoy learning, but learn because of different extrinsic motivations. Research shows that our education system evaluates students, teachers, and schools based on GPA as an extrinsic motivation for learning. This has two negative consequences:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Because of overjustification effect, extrinsic motivation diminishes intrinsic motivation for learning. The lower intrinsic motivation to learn, the lower meaningful learning, which consequently results in less creativity.</li>
                        <li>Evaluating design of learning systems based on GPA results misleads them to emphasize the wrong goals, namely "teach to the test."</li>
                      </ol>
                      <p>I actively design and develop an online community of learners who collaboratively learn and help each other through teaching and criticizing. They collectively discover joy of learning as scientists do. The community dynamically discovers easier and more enjoyable ways of learning each concept and relationships between concepts and shares the joy of their discoveries with the world.</p>

                      <p>• <strong>Findings:</strong> StackExchange provides incentives to contribute high quality answers, though no mechanism provided to learn topics. Wikipedia provides incentives for Wikipedians, though non-members have difficulty to learn the norms and leave after the first reverted edit. Wikipedia provides a learning structure within articles, but not between them.</p>

                      <p>Concept maps are graphical systems for understanding relationships between concepts, where nodes represent concepts and labeled links represent the relationships between them.</p>
                      <p>Concept maps have been used by constructivists to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects, as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government, and business. They are experimentally proven to improve learning development, understanding, memorizing, deductive reasoning, communication of ideas, assessment, idea generation, creativity, and critical thinking. They have been also leveraged in browsing web content in order to reduce cognitive overhead imposed by hypertext structure. Furthermore, Karpicke et. al. (2011) use concept mapping to measure elaborative studying.</p>
                      <p>However, most lab experiments that identified advantages of concept mapping have experimented with only a small amount of content that is often not realistic for a reasonable learning activity. As the amount of information represented via a concept map grows, visualizing many relations between concepts in a 2D space becomes confusing. Concept maps even get more confusing than the corresponding content in linear structures when the number of crossed linkages between concepts grow. This is one of the main reasons that usage of concept maps has been limited to very small amounts of content and the idea of Knowledge Arena has never become practical in the real world.</p>
                      <p>In this study, we are interested in interviewing people who have engaged in designing concept maps / mind maps for studying different courses and who are experienced in this method of studying. We are planning to learn about the experience they have gained through practice as professionals of concept mapping / mind mapping. As a result, we will be able to leverage this experience in designing an information architecture for searching, browsing, and learning.</p>

                      <p>We interviewed current users on the usability of the WeCollabrify suite of applications developed by our client, IMLC. Our research consisted of six student interviews and one teacher interview at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic School, Ann Arbor. We also observed a larger group of eight students using one application, WeMap, to organize information for a group science project.</p>

                      <p>One issue that we found is that although the applications are often used in the classroom and on take­home work, they are not used for studying or reviewing despite the fact that users can save any collaborative work session as a local tablet file. This means that some features of the applications are unused. A few minor usability issues also emerged with finding and participating in group sessions; they are difficult to find unless the spelling is exact. Students also mention that there is no way to regulate who is participating in a session and that they are frustrated with fellow classmates moving elements on the screen without approval.</p>

                      <p>Our recommendations include fixes to the functionality of the applications that would address specific problems. For example, we recommend that additional sorting choices should be offered for saved files, such as auto­completed text for saved files and being able to sort alphabetically. We also recommend re­introducing functions like printing and file sorting to the users in case the users may not be aware of them.</p>

                      <p>We also recommend that some regulation be added to group sessions. For example, we suggest that while individual users should be allowed to customize their view of the concept maps, the overall relationships between the nodes should stay the same for the entire group. We also suggest a fix for the resizing and customizing the view on WeChart.</p>

                      <p>Overall, the students appear to be engaged the applications and have no major complaints about usability. However, the teacher expressed concern that frequent use would gradually lessen the novelty and therefore the students’ interest in classroom activity via the applications; furthermore, they do not appear to use them outside of the classroom. We compared the WeSketch app to a similar app targeted to young people and suggest ways in which the presentation and customization of the products could be enhanced.</p>
