                      <p>Suri, et al. [1] explain that crowd-sourced jobs do not provide most of the incentives provided in real jobs. E.g., there is no advancement, no reputation, no organization membership, no benefits, no leadership, no identity, no recognition, and no collaboration. These are mosts of the motivators that Karau and Williams [2]' CEM suggest to incorporate in design of online communities to reduce social loafing. Some crowd-sourced platforms have incorporated parts of these incentives in their design or provided the crowd workers with tools to create these types of incentives for themselves. E.g., Amazon Mechanical Turkers share tasks with each other and inform each other about valuable HITs. They also create leadership for specific tasks.</p>

                      <p>From a constructivist learning [1] perspective, schools should encourage ownership and give learners a voice in the learning process. This is part of the reason schools encourage entrepreneurial activities. However, most course projects are left untouched and there are many barriers to starting up a business among students. These barriers include funding, protecting or sharing intellectual property, breaking down the projects and managing the development process, designing, developing, marketing, finance, etc. [2] On the other hand, students in different disciplines each learn parts of these skills through their courses.</p>

                      <p>I envision crowd-sourced entrepreneurship at schools, in which students crowdsource their startup ideas. The projects are collaboratively divided up into interconnected modules, distributed all over the institution, and student teams in different disciplines accomplish different modules of each project for course projects. Those who obtain the best outcome of the module achieve its ownership and teams emerge across disciplines from the successful teams on modules of the same project. As they learn about other teams who have successfully developed other modules of the project, they find a common ground that is the vision of the project and build friendship and partnership in the form of a startup. Finally, they will own shares of the startup based on the collaboratively assigned weights on modules they have developed.</p>

                      <p>In an interaction design course students design creative solutions as their projects. They enter their design in the crowd-sourced platform which is shared with other departments at the university. Law students who take intellectual property course select design solutions from the pool of projects and work on them as their course projects. MBA students at strategic management course take projects and divide them into manageable modules. Students at design courses take and work on the design modules; those at programing courses develop the relevant modules; those at marketing courses do the customer discovery; and so on. This way, the school turns into an ecosystem which not only does it teach students, but also it helps them to apply what they learn in real world. At the same time, this platform provides a great tool for investors to easily identify projects to invest in. Moreover, those projects that succeed at school, bring together students from different departments and build friendship among them based on a unified goal. This way they'll be able to easily form the start-up as a business entity after their graduation.</p>

                      <p>Although the benefits of creating concept maps for learning development [6], deductive reasoning, idea generation, critical thinking, and creativity have been recognized [1, 2, 4, 5], previous studies have focused on small content to be learned [3]. In addition, most studies have leveraged concept maps for learning among younger students. The proposed summer project is distinct from previous research in two important ways. First, I investigate to what extent concept maps would contribute to collaborative learning in higher education. Second, I examine how concept mapping can be designed and implemented as a learning technology to support collaborative learning in college.</p>

                      <p>Concept maps are graphical systems for understanding relationships between concepts, where nodes represent concepts and labeled links represent the relationships between them [1]. Cañas et al. [2] explain that nodes in a concept map should include only one or a few words. On one hand, this criterion results in more understandable nodes. On the other hand, by increasing the amount of content and keeping nodes small, visualizing many relations between concepts in a 2-dimensional map becomes challenging. This results in many crossed linkages and increasingly makes the map more confusing. To address this issue, Cañas et al. [2] define excellent concept maps as concise maps that answer only one focus question, though they do not discuss the relationship between many focus questions in a chapter of a college course. Having many separate concept maps for a course imposes cognitive overhead and contradicts the idea behind concept mapping that is to visualize the relationship between concepts throughout the course of learning. This issue has been less studied because the focus of concept mapping experiments has been on K-12 education and on small amounts of content that is possible to learn in lab settings. In practice, many learners tend to insert more information in each node to reduce the complexity of large concept maps.</p>

                      <p>Mentally grouping pieces together (chunking) allows human mind to condense the information actively tracked. The chunking theory has also been used in definition of concept maps [1] as propositions composed of highly related concepts and their relations, also called “semantic units or units of meaning” [2]. Joseph Novak [1] defines propositions as meaningful statements containing multiple interconnected concepts and makes concepts and propositions the central elements in the knowledge structure and meaning construction. Anderson et al. [3, 4] explain that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on declarative memory content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions.

                      <p>I intend to use design research [1] to identify design decisions in concept mapping that can make collaboration on concept maps more efficient for learning at the college level. For this purpose, I investigate the problem using a two-phase design over the summer of 2017. The first phase of the study will include concept map generation and qualitative research. This phase will result in two versions of the same concept map different in the design factor under the study. The purpose of the concept map generation in this phase is to produce “unbiased” concept maps of the same content that differ only in the design factor under the study. In the evaluation phase, two groups of students, control and treatment, will study the content using these two versions of the concept map and will be examined through a randomized controlled experiment. The detailed research plan is as follows:</p>

                      <p>Following the results of our experiments on hypothesis 1 over summer 2017, we investigate further design decisions. Both concept mapping [1] and mind mapping [2] theories encourage design of the map based on a “focus question”. However, while Cañas et al. [1] urge use of a hierarchical structure in concept maps, Buzan et al. [2, 3] suggest use of the focus question as the central node of mind maps. Both studies suggest improvement in learning and creativity using their proposed method. Cañas et al. [1] identify “the hierarchical structure that is represented in a good map and the ability to search for and characterize new cross-links” the two important features of concept maps in facilitation of creative thinking. Over the last decade both techniques have been largely used and online software have been developed and used by millions of users to facilitate design of mind maps and concept maps. A complete list of concept mapping and mind mapping tools is available at [5].</p>
                      <p>Davies [4] experimentally compares the use of mind maps and concept maps and concludes that each technique has its own applications. While Davies’ focus is on different methods of learning, we are going to further investigate design decisions in each technique that results in their applications in different contexts. The result of these experiments will yield in the development of a context-adaptive visual framework for knowledge sharing, searching, browsing, and learning in online platforms.
