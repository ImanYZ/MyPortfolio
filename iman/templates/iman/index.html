                      <p>I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, studying Information Sciences with strong technical and both analytical background, seeking a UX Research Internship.</p>
                      <p>I am honored for my work with Professor Yan Chen since April 2014. We investigate how people behave in online communities and how to design online communities to provide a safer and more motivating environment for members and non-members to join and contribute to.</p>
                      <p>Recently, I have been awarded a Rackham Graduate Student Research Grant to help defray the costs of conducting my research project "Learning How to Design to Learn". This is a multi-disciplinary joint project with Professor Soo Young Rieh at School of Information and Professor Chris Quintana at School of Education.</p>
                      <p>In Winter 2017, I am a Graduate Student Instructor at the University of Michigan, teaching data analysis and visualization in Python using NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas. This class is being taught by Professor Eytan Adar.</p>

                      <p>This study investigates the extent to which different incentives might motivate domain experts to contribute to Wikipedia by conducting randomized field experiments on Wikipedia. We explore the impact of social amplifier on the private benefit from contributing to the public good. When an expert edits a Wikipedia article relevant to her research, the private benefit is multiplied by the number of people who view that article. To measure the effect of the social amplifier, we introduce exogenous variations on the number of times the recommended Wikipedia articles have been viewed over the last 30 days. We are conducting a controlled field experiment by delivering different versions of an email message inviting researchers world-wide to contribute to Wikipedia. By studying participants' behavioral responses to various incentives using a 3×2×2 factorial design, this research investigates the incentives that might motivate scholars to contribute to Wikipedia.</p>

                      <p>I believe education system needs to produce learning lovers who enjoy finding things out for themselves, otherwise the system will produce proficient test takers who do not enjoy learning, but learn because of different extrinsic motivations. Research shows that our education system evaluates students, teachers, and schools based on GPA as an extrinsic motivation for learning. This has two negative consequences:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Because of overjustification effect, extrinsic motivation diminishes intrinsic motivation for learning. The lower intrinsic motivation to learn, the lower meaningful learning, which consequently results in less creativity.</li>
                        <li>Evaluating design of learning systems based on GPA results misleads them to emphasize the wrong goals, namely "teach to the test."</li>

                      <p>Crowd-sourced jobs do not provide most of the incentives provided in real jobs. Successful crowd-sourced platforms have incorporated parts of these incentives in their design or provided the crowd workers with tools to create these types of incentives for themselves.</p>
                      <p>From a constructivist learning perspective, schools should encourage ownership and give learners a voice in the learning process. That's part of the reason schools encourage entrepreneurial activities. However, most of course projects are left untouched and there are many barriers to start-up a business among students. </p>

                      <p>In order to evaluate this impact, we collected the complete editing history of 9,000 registered top editors and the number of characters in each entry. The causal relationship is inferred by the method of matching, which compares the editing behavior of treated editors, members of at least one WikiProject, with non-members who have similar characteristics, such as lifetime at Wikipedia and editing activeness before the focal week. We invoke the assumption of selection on observables by the fact that a typical user’s exposure to a WikiProject depends on the duration of membership and the amount of contribution to articles under the Wikiproject. Because editors’ selection into WikiProject is susceptible to transitory shock, we use difference-in-difference estimator to single out the temporally invariant differences between treated and untreated editors.</p>

                      <p>We present a lab-in-the-field experiment to demonstrate how individual behavior in the lab predicts their ability to identify phishing attempts. Using the business and finance staff members from a large public university in the U.S., we find that participants who are intolerant of risk, more curious, and less trusting commit significantly more false positive errors in an information security quiz. We also replicate prior results on demographics, including age, gender, and education level. Our results suggest that behavioral characteristics such as risk attitude, curiosity, and trust can be used to predict individual ability to identify phishing interfaces.</p>

                      <p>Our study will empirically explore how human behavior changes with varying incentive structures in the form of contests for leaderboard recognition. Using lab experiments, we will distribute a classification task (the Knapsack game) to a group of subjects, controlling for the type of tournament each subject participates in. The contests will vary with regard to the exact payment scheme used and the number of leaderboard slots allocated to participants. We will then capture a measure of effort each person has exerted in order to find the correlation between effort expenditure and contest.</p>

                      <p>Concept maps are graphical systems for understanding relationships between concepts, where nodes represent concepts and labeled links represent the relationships between them.</p>
                      <p>Concept maps have been used by constructivists to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects, as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government, and business. They are experimentally proven to improve learning development, understanding, memorizing, deductive reasoning, communication of ideas, assessment, idea generation, creativity, and critical thinking. They have been also leveraged in browsing web content in order to reduce cognitive overhead imposed by hypertext structure. Furthermore, Karpicke et. al. (2011) use concept mapping to measure elaborative studying.</p>
                      <p>However, most lab experiments that identified advantages of concept mapping have experimented with only a small amount of content that is often not realistic for a reasonable learning activity. As the amount of information represented via a concept map grows, visualizing many relations between concepts in a 2D space becomes confusing. Concept maps even get more confusing than the corresponding content in linear structures when the number of crossed linkages between concepts grow. This is one of the main reasons that usage of concept maps has been limited to very small amounts of content and the idea of Knowledge Arena has never become practical in the real world.</p>
                      <p>In this study, we are interested in interviewing people who have engaged in designing concept maps / mind maps for studying different courses and who are experienced in this method of studying. We are planning to learn about the experience they have gained through practice as professionals of concept mapping / mind mapping. As a result, we will be able to leverage this experience in designing an information architecture for searching, browsing, and learning.</p>

                      <p>Wikipedia is a global example of computer supported cooperative work. Over time, Wikipedia has developed formal and informal social structures and guides to improve and maintain the quality of its contents and further its role as a source of encyclopedic knowledge and a volunteer community.  Graduate students and alumni of the University of Michigan are interviewed in order to understand how people interacted with Wikipedia. We investigate to what extent this community of people use Wikipedia and contribute to it. The main purpose of this study is to identify the affordances and constraints that Wikipedia provides for its users and contributors. In particular, how goals, roles, norms, incentives and rewards, conflicts, activities, representation of self, representation of others, representations of activities, and social regulations are formed, how they govern the community, and to what extent each of these factors contribute to credibility of social work on Wikipedia and affects the expectations of its users and contributors.</p>

                      <p>Advisor: Professor Paul Resnick</p>
                      <p>Abstract: Some rumors spread quickly and widely through social media. Journalists write about them, both to help the public understand whether they are true, and to help the public understand how widely misinformation and corrections have spread, and how they did. We describe RumorLens, a suite of interactive tools that are designed to help journalists identify new rumors on Twitter and assess the audiences that rumor and correction tweets have reached. The tools make efficient use of human labor to assess whether a rumor’s content is interesting enough to warrant further exploration, to label tweets as spreading, correcting, or unrelated to the rumor, and to analyze the rumor visually. Behind the scenes, automated learning and computation amplifies the effectiveness of that labor, making it feasible to engage journalists and the broader public to run a continuous rumor-monitoring service.</p>
